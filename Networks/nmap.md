# Nmap
### Types of Scans
- ARP scan: This scan uses ARP requests to discover live hosts
- ICMP scan: This scan uses ICMP requests to identify live hosts
- TCP/UDP ping scan: This scan sends packets to TCP ports and UDP ports to determine live hosts.

## Subnetworks
In an IP network, a subnetwork is usually the equivalent of one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router. The network segment refers to a physical connection, while a subnetwork refers to a logical connection.

If you are connected to the same subnet, you would expect your scanner to rely on <b>ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) queries to discover live hosts</b>. 

### ARP Request
An ARP query aims to get the hardware address (MAC address) so that communication over the link-layer becomes possible; however, we can use this to infer that the host is online.<br>

If you are in Network A, you can use ARP only to discover the devices within that subnet (10.1.100.0/24). Suppose you are connected to a subnet different from the subnet of the target system(s). In that case, all packets generated by your scanner will be routed via the default gateway (router) to reach the systems on another subnet; however, the ARP queries won’t be routed and hence cannot cross the subnet router. ARP is a link-layer protocol, and ARP packets are bound to their subnet.

## Enumerating Targets
Generally speaking, you can provide a list, a range, or a subnet. Examples of target specification are:

- list: MACHINE_IP scanme.nmap.org example.com will scan 3 IP addresses.
- range: 10.11.12.15-20 will scan 6 IP addresses: 10.11.12.15, 10.11.12.16,… and 10.11.12.20.
- subnet: MACHINE_IP/30 will scan 4 IP addresses.
- A file as input for your list of targets, nmap -iL list_of_hosts.txt

If you want to check the list of hosts that Nmap will scan, you can use nmap -sL TARGETS. This option will give you a detailed list of the hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them; however, Nmap will attempt a reverse-DNS resolution on all the targets to obtain their names. Names might reveal various information to the pentester. (If you don’t want Nmap to the DNS server, you can add -n.)

# Live Host Discovery
- ARP from Link Layer
- ICMP from Network Layer. ICMP ping uses Type 8 (Echo) and Type 0 (Echo Reply).
- TCP from Transport Layer
- UDP from Transport Layer

## Live Hosts with ARP
Nmap follows the following approaches to discover live hosts:

- When a privileged user tries to scan targets on a local network (Ethernet), Nmap uses ARP requests. A privileged user is root or a user who belongs to sudoers and can run sudo.
- When a privileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap uses ICMP echo requests, TCP ACK (Acknowledge) to port 80, TCP SYN (Synchronize) to port 443, and ICMP timestamp request.
- When an unprivileged user tries to scan targets outside the local network, Nmap resorts to a TCP 3-way handshake by sending SYN packets to ports 80 and 443.

if you want to use Nmap to discover online hosts without port-scanning the live systems, you can issue <b>nmap -sn TARGETS</b><br>

To get the MAC address, the OS sends an ARP query. A host that replies to ARP queries is up. The ARP query only works if the target is on the same subnet as yourself, i.e., on the same Ethernet/WiFi. You should expect to see many ARP queries generated during a Nmap scan of a local network. If you want Nmap only to perform an ARP scan without port-scanning, you can use <b>nmap -PR -sn TARGETS/subnet, where -PR indicates that you only want an ARP scan.</b>

## Live Hosts with ICMP
We can ping every IP address on a target network and see who would respond to our ping (ICMP Type 8/Echo) requests with a ping reply (ICMP Type 0).
<br> command: <b>nmap -PE -sn MACHINE_IP/24</b> <br>

<br>Because ICMP echo requests tend to be blocked, you might also consider ICMP Timestamp or ICMP Address Mask requests to tell if a system is online. Nmap uses timestamp request (ICMP Type 13) and checks whether it will get a Timestamp reply (ICMP Type 14). Adding the -PP option tells Nmap to use ICMP timestamp requests. As shown in the figure below, you expect live hosts to reply. <br>

<br>Similarly, Nmap uses address mask queries (ICMP Type 17) and checks whether it gets an address mask reply (ICMP Type 18). This scan can be enabled with the option -PM. As shown in the figure below, live hosts are expected to reply to ICMP address mask requests. <br>

## Live Hosts with TCP and UDP

### TCP SYN Ping
We can send a packet with the SYN (Synchronize) flag set to a TCP port, 80 by default, and wait for a response. An open port should reply with a SYN/ACK (Acknowledge); a closed port would result in an RST (Reset). In this case, we only check whether we will get any response to infer whether the host is up.

<img src = "https://tryhackme-images.s3.amazonaws.com/user-uploads/5f04259cf9bf5b57aed2c476/room-content/23e7f481f78de8d3e89ef845b747002d.png">
<br>If you want Nmap to use TCP SYN ping, you can do so via the option -PS followed by the port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, -PS21 will target port 21, while -PS21-25 will target ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25. Finally -PS80,443,8080 will target the three ports 80, 443, and 8080.

<br>

### TCP ACK Ping
this sends a packet with an ACK flag set. You must be running Nmap as a privileged user to be able to accomplish this. If you try it as an unprivileged user, Nmap will attempt a 3-way handshake.
<br>
By default, port 80 is used. The syntax is similar to TCP SYN ping. -PA should be followed by a port number, range, list, or a combination of them. For example, consider -PA21, -PA21-25 and -PA80,443,8080. If no port is specified, port 80 will be used.
<br>
The following figure shows that any TCP packet with an ACK flag should get a TCP packet back with an RST flag set. The target responds with the RST flag set because the TCP packet with the ACK flag is not part of any ongoing connection. The expected response is used to detect if the target host is up.

### UDP Ping
Finally, we can use UDP to discover if the host is online. Contrary to TCP SYN ping, sending a UDP packet to an open port is not expected to lead to any reply. However, if we send a UDP packet to a closed UDP port, we expect to get an ICMP port unreachable packet; this indicates that the target system is up and available.
<br>
In the following figure, we see a UDP packet sent to an open UDP port and not triggering any response. However, sending a UDP packet to any closed UDP port can trigger a response indirectly indicating that the target is online.

### Reverse DNS Lookup
Nmap’s default behaviour is to use reverse-DNS online hosts. Because the hostnames can reveal a lot, this can be a helpful step. However, if you don’t want to send such DNS queries, you use -n to skip this step.
<br>
By default, Nmap will look up online hosts; however, you can use the option -R to query the DNS server even for offline hosts. If you want to use a specific DNS server, you can add the --dns-servers DNS_SERVER option.<br>
